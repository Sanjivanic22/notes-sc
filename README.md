# Core java
Core Java refers to the fundamental components of the Java programming language, including its syntax, language constructs, and standard libraries. Java is a general-purpose programming language that is used for a wide range of applications, from developing desktop applications to building web applications, mobile apps, and enterprise systems.


## Jdbc
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is a Java API used for connecting Java applications to relational databases. It provides a standard interface for Java applications to access and manipulate data stored in databases, regardless of the specific database management system (DBMS) being used.

## Servlet
Servlets are a Java technology used for creating server-side web applications. They are designed to handle requests from clients (e.g., web browsers) and generate dynamic responses based on the client's request.

## Jsp
SP (JavaServer Pages) is a technology used for developing web applications in Java. It allows developers to write dynamic web pages using Java code that can interact with databases, handle form data, and generate dynamic HTML content.

Spring 
Spring is a popular Java framework used for building enterprise-level applications. It provides a range of features and modules that can be used to simplify the development process, increase productivity, and improve application performance.

Hibernate 
Hibernate is an open-source object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for Java that provides a convenient way to map Java objects to database tables. It simplifies the process of working with relational databases by eliminating the need to write SQL code manually, and provides a range of features for managing database transactions, querying data, and mapping objects to database tables.
Some common uses of Hibernate include


Webservices
Integration of two different applications which might be running in same Server or different Server, also applications developed in same language. 

To do integration, minimum two applications are required, in that one application behaves like Provider and another application behaves like Consumer


Springboot 
Spring Boot is a popular open-source framework for building Java-based applications. It is built on top of the Spring framework and provides a range of features and modules that can be used to simplify the development process, increase productivity, and improve application performance.

microservices
Microservices is a software architecture style that involves developing applications as a suite of small, independently deployable services that communicate with each other through lightweight APIs. Each service is designed to perform a specific business function and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, allowing for greater agility, flexibility, and scalability.

 
Spring rest
Spring rest is part of spring framework wich is used to develop the restfull webservices .in java
Spring REST is a module of the Spring Framework that is used to build RESTful web services. REST stands for Representational State Transfer and is an architectural style that is used for designing distributed systems, such as web services.
