## what is monolithic architecture
-----------------------------------------
Microservice is an architectural style for designing and building software applications as a collection of small, independent, and 
loosely coupled services.that communicate with other over well defined API'S.  In this approach, an application is divided into a set of services, 
each representing a specific business capability and running as a separate process or container.

## what is diferance b/w Microservice and Monolithic architecture.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Microservices                                                             
1)are small and focused on bussiness capabilities.
2)Microservices can developed,deployed and scaled independatly.allowing  for agility and flexibility.
3)microservices are allow to use of diffenert tecnology,programming language for each service depending on the specific requirement

 Monolithic
--------------
1)Monolthic are larger and contains all functionality in signle unit
2)monolithic requirs the entire application to be delpoyed and scale.d as whole
3) entire application is developed in single technology stack.

Advatanges 
---------------
1)Scalability
2)felexibility and agility
3)modularity and maintanability
4) microservices architecture allow you to use diffrenet tecnnologies ,programming language and framework based on there requirement.
5) with the microservces if one service fails or experiences issue.it doesnt affect the entire system.
service can be designed to handle failure gracefully. and implement resillience .such as circuit breaker or retry mechnism.
6) ensure scalability and performance
microservice can optimize resource allocation by allowing each service to scale indepently based on the requirement.

What is Api gateways?
-----------------------
In microservice architerure an ApI gateway is server side componenet that acts as an entry point or facade for client application to access the 
underlaying microservices.
it provides centralized point,encapsulating the complexity of the ms ecosystem and offering a unified interface to the client.
API gateway handle incoming client request and route them to the appropriate MS based the requested API endpoint.
it can handle the authentication and authorzation validate caces token.

What is cicuit braking and wh to y it is so important?
-------------------------------------------------------------
circuit breaking is mechanism use in microservice to improve the resillience and functinonality of the system.
it helps to prevent failure in once service from cascading and affecting the overall system.

circuit breaking is mechanism to handle the service failure prevent cascading failures and imrpove the system resillince .
it enables services and client application to handle n/w and service disruption more effectively leading to more robust and eliable MS.

What is fallback method with circuit breaker?
-------------------------------------------------
WHat is Eureka server?
=-----------------------
Eureka server is compoent of netflix,service discovery and resistration tool for building microservice based application.
eureka server acts as centralized registry where MS can register themselves and discover service within the system.
eureka servver server provides diffenet kind of functionality.
service registration
service discovery
load balancing
failover and fault tolarance

what is service descovery?
-----------------------------
Microservices can query the eureka server to discover other registed services and obtain thair metadata.
this them to dynamically locate and communicate with other service without hardcoding their locations.

What is load balancing
in mS architure load balancer play crucial role in distributing incoming n/w  traffice across the multiple instace of service.
it help to optmize resource utilization improve scalability and ensure high availabiliy.

Containeratin?
--------------
container pkges the microservices with its dependancies .making it easier to deploy and manage across diff env.
